# Model Information 

# Proposed models (by 2025)
1. Naive - the models which are trained on datased provided by Edge Impulse keyword recognition documentation (link to be added here) and "Hello Airi"'s recording are sampled by actual human voice with high variance.
2. synthetic - Same as naive, but only cahnge is that "hello Airi" dataset is synthetically generated using 'Coqui-tts-synthesizer' (link to directory is to be added here)
The prepared models would be the most effective optimised int8 only model in that Impulse created using variations like:
1. MFE and transfer learning (keyword recognition)
2. MFCC and regular NN classifier
